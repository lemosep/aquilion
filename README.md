# Aquilion
## About
Aquilion is a hobbyist operating with the sole purpose of understanding how an operating system works, every step of the way is meant to be documented in my [YouTube series] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf2MHt8xJ5Y&list=PL99XpV32SINAn1KSzcbkqvj_kaClThzxi) and [my blog](https://lemosep.com).

## Architecture
This OS also has it's own bootloader (x86), so it might take a while for me to actually start writing the kernel.
